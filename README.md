## Servlet MVC
MVC pattern stands for Model-View-Controller. It is used to seperate application's concern.

* Model : Model represents an object or Java POJO carrying data. It can also have to update controller if its data changes.
* View : View represents the visualization of the data that model consists.
* Controller : Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model seperate.
