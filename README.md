Defines the attributes that apply to an entire JSP page.

### Syntax of JSP page directive.
``<%@ page attribute = "value"/>``

### Attributes of JSP page directive
| Attribute | Description | Example |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| import | Used to import class, interface or all the members of a package. Similar to import keyword in java. | ``<%@ page import="java.util.Date">`` |
| contentType | Defines the MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) type of the HTTP response. | ``<%@page contentType="text/html"%>`` |
| extends | Defines the parent class that will be inherited by the generated servlet. | ``<%@page extends="somePackage.SomeClass"%>`` |
| info | sets the information of the JSP page which is retrieved later by using getServletInfo() method of servlet instance | ``<%@page info="exception handling page">`` |
| buffer | sets the buffer size in kilobyte to handle output generated by the JSP page. Default size is 8Kb. | ``<%@page buffer=16Kb%>`` |
| language | Indicates the programming language used in scripting the JSP page. Default is Java.| ``<%@page language="java">`` |
| isThreadSafe | The isThreadSafe option marks a page as being thread-safe. By default, all JSPs are considered thread-safe. If you set the isThreadSafe option to false, the JSP engine makes sure that only one thread at a time is executing your JSP. | ``<%@page isThreadSafe="false"%>``|  
| session |   The session attribute indicates whether or not the JSP page uses HTTP sessions. A value of true means that the JSP page has access to a builtin session object and a value of false means that the JSP page cannot access the builtin session object. Following directive allows the JSP page to use any of the builtin object session methods such as session.getCreationTime() or session.getLastAccessTime() | ``<%@ page session="true" %>``| 
| isEliIgnored | The isELIgnored attribute gives you the ability to disable the evaluation of Expression Language (EL) expressions which has been introduced in JSP 2.0. The default value of the attribute is true, meaning that expressions, ${...}, are evaluated as dictated by the JSP specification. If the attribute is set to false, then expressions are not evaluated but rather treated as static text. | ``<%@ page isELIgnored="false" %>`` | 
| isScriptingEnabled | The isScriptingEnabled attribute determines if the scripting elements are allowed for use. The default value (true) enables scriptlets, expressions, and declarations. If the attribute's value is set to false, a translation-time error will be raised if the JSP uses any scriptlets, expressions (non-EL), or declarations. | ``<%@ page isScriptingEnabled="false" %>``|
